# Code path
I will try several baseline models, and try to modify their codes.

Please help check the codes in **"dimension/xxx_vital/kbc/xxx.py"**,  
the codes in **"dimension/xxx_try"** could be noisy because I will do some tests there.

# My methods
1. constrain the parameters with **hermitian matrix**, **semi-hermitian matrix**.
